The first problem in Turing.com Coding Challenge. This class can process the string to make a score

```php
/**
* Rules
*/
// Keep the score for a baseball game with strange rules. 
// -> "numeric" - record a new score.
// -> "D" - Delete previous score from the record.
// -> "C" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
// -> "+" - Record a new score that is double the previous score.
// Return the sum of all the scores record.

/**
* Example
*/
$input = "10 10 C";
$total = 40;

$input = "10 10 C D";
$total = 20;

$input = "10 + +";
$total = 70;

$input = "10 100 200 D C + 10";
$total = 450;

$input = "D";
$total = 0;
```

## Kurawa Class
Kurawa class given validated parentheses 

```php
/**
* Given a string containing just the characters '{','}','(',')','[',']', determine if the input string valid.
*/
//An input string is valid if :
//-> Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
//-> Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

/**
* Example.
*/
$input = "{}";
$output = True;

$input = "()[]({[]})";
$output = True;

$input = "[({([{[([])]}])})]";
$output = True;

$input = "{";
$output = False;

$input = "[({([{[([])]}])})";
$output = False;
